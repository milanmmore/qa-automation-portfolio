    <h2><strong>What is JavaScript?</strong></h2>

    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the
    ECMAScript specification. It is a versatile language primarily known for adding interactivity
    to web pages, but has evolved to become one of the most widely used programming
    languages in the world. JavaScript enables dynamic content, controls multimedia,
    animates images, and pretty much everything else on the web.</p>

    <p>Unlike HTML and CSS, which are markup and styling languages respectively, JavaScript
    is a full-fledged programming language that allows developers to implement complex
    features on web pages. When a web page does more than just sit there and display static
    information—displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated graphics,
    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.—JavaScript is likely involved. </p>

    <p>JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which means it can be executed directly in
    the user's browser without needing to communicate with the server. This makes web
    applications faster and more responsive to user interactions.
