please give me sample url where I can use vault and step by step guide to practice it. please give me detailed integrstion with vault which I can use with this project Absolutely, Milan! Since you're building a capstone project around API testing with Playwright and TypeScript, integrating HashiCorp Vault for secrets management is a brilliant move. Here's a complete hands-on guide with a sample project and step-by-step integration.

🌐 Sample Project URL to Practice Vault Integration You can start with HashiCorp’s official Vault App Integration Tutorials — they walk you through multiple real-world scenarios including GitHub Actions, Spring apps, and AWS Lambda.

For code examples, check out the Vault Examples GitHub Repo — it includes snippets for Node.js, Go, Python, and more.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Vault Integration for Your API Test Project Let’s assume you’re testing an e-commerce API and want to securely inject secrets (e.g., auth tokens, DB credentials) into your Playwright test suite.

🔧 Step 1: Install and Run Vault Locally bash

Download Vault
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.15.0/vault_1.15.0_linux_amd64.zip unzip vault_1.15.0_linux_amd64.zip sudo mv vault /usr/local/bin/

Create config file
echo ' ui = true storage "file" { path = "/vault-data" } listener "tcp" { address = "127.0.0.1:8200" tls_disable = 1 } ' > config.hcl

Start Vault
vault server -config=config.hcl Access the UI at: http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui

🔐 Step 2: Initialize and Unseal Vault bash vault operator init vault operator unseal <key1> vault operator unseal <key2> vault operator unseal <key3> Save the root token — you’ll use it to authenticate.

📦 Step 3: Enable KV Secrets Engine bash vault login <your-root-token> vault secrets enable -path=secret kv vault kv put secret/ecommerce-api token="s3cr3t-t0k3n" db_pass="p@ssw0rd" 🧪 Step 4: Integrate with Playwright Test Suite Create a utility to fetch secrets using Vault’s HTTP API:

ts // utils/vaultClient.ts import axios from 'axios';

export async function getVaultSecret(path: string): Promise<any> { const VAULT_ADDR = 'http://127.0.0.1:8200'; const VAULT_TOKEN = process.env.VAULT_TOKEN;

const res = await axios.get(${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/secret/data/${path}, { headers: { 'X-Vault-Token': VAULT_TOKEN }, });

return res.data.data.data; } Use it in your Playwright config or fixtures:

ts // playwright.config.ts import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'; import { getVaultSecret } from './utils/vaultClient';

const secrets = await getVaultSecret('ecommerce-api');

export default defineConfig({ use: { baseURL: 'https://api.example.com', extraHTTPHeaders: { Authorization: Bearer ${secrets.token}, }, }, }); 🔁 Step 5: Automate with GitHub Actions yaml

.github/workflows/test.yml
env: VAULT_ADDR: http://127.0.0.1:8200 VAULT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}

jobs: test: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Install deps
  run: npm install

- name: Run tests
  run: npx playwright test
  🧠 Bonus: Use Vault Agent for Auto-Auth You can configure Vault Agent to auto-authenticate and inject secrets into environment variables or files — perfect for CI/CD or containerized environments.

Would you like me to scaffold a mini repo with this setup and sample Playwright tests? Or help you integrate role-based secrets for admin vs user flows?

Edit in a page mini repo with this setup and sample Playwright tests and ntegrate role-based secrets for admin vs user flows. Absolutely, Milan — this is going to be a slick, modular setup that showcases secure Vault integration, role-based secrets, and Playwright API testing in TypeScript. Here's a full breakdown of the mini repo structure, sample code, and how to wire it all together.

🗂️ Project Structure plaintext vault-playwright-demo/ ├── .github/ │ └── workflows/ │ └── ci.yml # GitHub Actions for CI ├── playwright/ │ ├── tests/ │ │ ├── admin.spec.ts # Admin API tests │ │ └── user.spec.ts # User API tests │ ├── fixtures/ │ │ └── auth.fixture.ts # Role-based auth fixture │ └── utils/ │ └── vaultClient.ts # Vault integration ├── vault/ │ └── seed.sh # Script to seed Vault with secrets ├── playwright.config.ts ├── package.json └── README.md 🔐 Vault Setup: Role-Based Secrets vault/seed.sh bash #!/bin/bash vault login $VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN

vault kv put secret/api/admin token="admin-secret-token" vault kv put secret/api/user token="user-secret-token" Run this after starting Vault locally (vault server -config=config.hcl).

🔧 Vault Client Utility playwright/utils/vaultClient.ts ts import axios from 'axios';

export async function getVaultSecret(role: 'admin' | 'user') { const VAULT_ADDR = process.env.VAULT_ADDR || 'http://127.0.0.1:8200'; const VAULT_TOKEN = process.env.VAULT_TOKEN;

const path = secret/data/api/${role}; const res = await axios.get(${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/${path}, { headers: { 'X-Vault-Token': VAULT_TOKEN }, });

return res.data.data.data.token; } 🧪 Playwright Auth Fixture playwright/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts ts import { test as base } from '@playwright/test'; import { getVaultSecret } from '../utils/vaultClient';

type Role = 'admin' | 'user';

export const test = base.extend<{ authToken: string; }>({ authToken: async ({}, use, testInfo) => { const role: Role = testInfo.title.includes('Admin') ? 'admin' : 'user'; const token = await getVaultSecret(role); await use(token); }, });

export { expect } from '@playwright/test'; ✅ Sample Test: Admin playwright/tests/admin.spec.ts ts import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/auth.fixture';

test('Admin can access protected endpoint', async ({ request, authToken }) => { const res = await request.get('/admin/dashboard', { headers: { Authorization: Bearer ${authToken} }, });

expect(res.status()).toBe(200); }); 👤 Sample Test: User playwright/tests/user.spec.ts ts import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/auth.fixture';

test('User can view product catalog', async ({ request, authToken }) => { const res = await request.get('/products', { headers: { Authorization: Bearer ${authToken} }, });

expect(res.status()).toBe(200); }); 🚀 GitHub Actions CI .github/workflows/ci.yml yaml name: Playwright Tests

what else I can use other than axios ? Great question, Milan — if you're looking to pull secrets from Vault or make HTTP requests in Node.js, there are several solid alternatives to axios, each with its own strengths depending on your use case (performance, streaming, native support, etc.).

🔄 Alternatives to axios for HTTP Requests

Node’s Native https Module ts import https from 'https';

https.get('https://vault.example.com/v1/secret/data/myapp', res => { let data = ''; res.on('data', chunk => (data += chunk)); res.on('end', () => { const parsed = JSON.parse(data); console.log(parsed); }); }); ✅ No external dependencies

❌ Verbose and less ergonomic

💡 Good for low-level control or environments with strict dependency policies

node-fetch ts import fetch from 'node-fetch';

const res = await fetch('https://vault.example.com/v1/secret/data/myapp', { headers: { 'X-Vault-Token': process.env.VAULT_TOKEN }, }); const data = await res.json(); ✅ Lightweight and Promise-based

✅ Similar to browser fetch

❌ No built-in retries or interceptors

Great for simple Vault integrations or CI scripts

got ts import got from 'got';

const response = await got.get('https://vault.example.com/v1/secret/data/myapp', { headers: { 'X-Vault-Token': process.env.VAULT_TOKEN }, responseType: 'json', }); console.log(response.body); ✅ Powerful, modern, and fast

✅ Built-in retries, hooks, streaming

✅ Supports HTTP/2

💡 Ideal for production-grade Vault clients

superagent ts import superagent from 'superagent';

const res = await superagent .get('https://vault.example.com/v1/secret/data/myapp') .set('X-Vault-Token', process.env.VAULT_TOKEN); console.log(res.body); ✅ Easy chaining syntax

✅ Good for testing and quick scripts

❌ Slightly heavier than node-fetch

🔐 For Vault-Specific Use Cases If you're working with Vault frequently, you might also explore:

node-vault: A dedicated Vault client for Node.js

ts import vault from 'node-vault'; const client = vault({ endpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:8200', token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN }); const secret = await client.read('secret/data/myapp'); ✅ Handles auth, KV engine, and token renewal

✅ Great for structured Vault workflows

Let me know your priorities — performance, simplicity, retries, or streaming — and I’ll help you pick the best fit for your test harness. Want me to refactor your Vault client to use got or node-fetch with role-based token support?

I want to use vault to keep my db-credentials and other secrets into vault for security purpose That’s a smart move, Milan — using HashiCorp Vault to store DB credentials and secrets is a huge step toward secure, scalable automation. Let’s break it down into a modular, CI/CD-friendly setup that fits your style:

🔐 Why Use Vault for Secrets? ✅ Centralized secrets management

✅ Dynamic secrets (e.g., DB creds that auto-expire)

✅ Fine-grained access control via policies

✅ Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines

🧱 Setup Overview Here’s a clean, reusable flow for storing and retrieving secrets:

Enable KV Secrets Engine bash vault secrets enable -path=secret kv-v2

Store Secrets bash vault kv put secret/db-creds
username="db_user"
password="super_secure_password"

Access Secrets via CLI bash vault kv get secret/db-creds Or programmatically via API:

ts import got from 'got';

const VAULT_ADDR = 'http://127.0.0.1:8200'; const VAULT_TOKEN = process.env.VAULT_TOKEN;

const res = await got(${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/secret/data/db-creds, { headers: { 'X-Vault-Token': VAULT_TOKEN }, responseType: 'json', });

const { username, password } = res.body.data.data; 🔄 Dynamic DB Credentials (Optional but Powerful) If you're using PostgreSQL or MySQL, Vault can generate short-lived DB creds:

bash vault secrets enable database

vault write database/config/my-db
plugin_name=mysql-database-plugin
connection_url="{{username}}:{{password}}@tcp(your-db-host:3306)/"
allowed_roles="readonly"
username="vaultuser"
password="vaultpass"

vault write database/roles/readonly
db_name=my-db
creation_statements="CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}'; GRANT SELECT ON . TO '{{name}}'@'%';"
default_ttl="1h"
max_ttl="24h" Then retrieve dynamic creds:

bash vault read database/creds/readonly 🔧 CI/CD Integration Tips Store Vault token securely in your CI secrets manager

Use environment variables to inject token and Vault address

Use got, node-fetch, or node-vault to fetch secrets before test runs

Rotate secrets regularly and enforce TTLs

Want me to help you scaffold a Vault client utility in TypeScript that plugs into your Playwright test harness and CI pipeline? I can make it modular, secure, and ready for production.2

Edit in a page Also vault which I can use for practice free of cost. my credentials will not be stored on github repo which is public. Absolutely, Milan — you can practice with Vault securely and for free without exposing any secrets to public repos. Here's a clean breakdown of your options:

🧪 Free Ways to Practice with Vault

Local Vault Dev Server (Best for Hands-On Practice) Run Vault locally in dev mode:

bash vault server -dev ✅ No cost, no internet required

✅ Fast startup with in-memory storage

❌ Not secure for production (auto-unsealed, root token exposed)

Perfect for testing secret storage, policies, and API calls with mock data.

Docker-Based Vault Setup bash docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -p 8200:8200 hashicorp/vault ✅ Isolated container environment

✅ Easy to reset and script

✅ Great for CI/CD simulation

Free Cloud Sandbox (HashiCorp Cloud Platform) HashiCorp offers a free tier on HCP Vault — ideal for cloud-based practice.

✅ Secure, managed Vault instance

✅ Free tier available with limited usage

✅ Great for learning auth methods, dynamic secrets, and integrations

🔐 Keeping Secrets Out of GitHub To avoid storing credentials in public repos:

Use .env files and add them to .gitignore

Inject secrets via CI/CD environment variables

Use Vault to fetch secrets at runtime (e.g., in Playwright setup)

Example .gitignore:

Code .env vault-token.txt secrets.json And in your code:

ts import dotenv from 'dotenv'; dotenv.config();

const VAULT_TOKEN = process.env.VAULT_TOKEN; 🧰 Bonus: Practice Resources Free Vault-Associate Practice Test — no login required
