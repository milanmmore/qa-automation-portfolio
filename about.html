        <!--h2>🚀 My QA Journey</h2>-->
        <p>From a non-IT background to leading QA teams—here’s how I built a fulfilling career in software testing and automation.
</p>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h3>🌱 Humble Beginnings</h3>
                <p>
                    My journey began in science, inspired by my mother’s belief that <em></em><strong>“Education is the most powerful gift you
                        can give yourself.”</strong></em> I completed a Master’s in Inorganic Chemistry, but after moving to Pune
        post-marriage, I pivoted toward tech—driven by curiosity and opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
        With my husband’s support, I pursued a computer course and later an MBA. During the Y2K era, I entered IT as a
        developer, but the emerging QA role resonated deeply. Testing gave me not just a career—it gave me purpose.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="quote center-quote">
        <strong>“Sometimes the best paths are the ones we never planned. Testing found me—and I found myself in
            it.”</strong>
    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Over time, I embraced automation, mastering tools like <strong>Selenium</strong>,
                        <strong>Cypress</strong>,
                        and <strong>Playwright</strong>. When automation was booming, many believed testers would be
                        replaced by
                        developers. That didn’t happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, with the rise of AI, the same fear resurfaces. But here’s what I’ve learned:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="quote center-quote">
                        <strong>“AI won’t replace testers. But testers who embrace AI will replace those who
                            don’t.”</strong>
                    </blockquote>

    <p>
        I started with no formal IT background—and I made it. <strong>So why not you?</strong> If you're curious,
        committed, and willing to learn, the path is open.
    </p>
    <p>
        My story isn’t just mine—it’s proof that with the right mindset, anyone can thrive in tech. <strong>Let’s build
            your journey together.</strong>

                <h3>🧠 Learning the Craft</h3>
                <p>
                    I began with manual testing, mastering test design, edge cases, and user empathy. Over time, I
                    transitioned
                    into automation using <strong>Selenium</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and
                    <strong>TypeScript</strong>,
                    discovering the power of precision and repeatability.

                <h3>🛠️ Automation & Framework Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    I architected scalable frameworks using <strong>Playwright</strong>, <strong>Cypress</strong>, and
                    <strong>Selenium</strong>. My focus: modular design, CI/CD integration, and maintainability—ensuring
                    automation supports long-term quality.

                <h3>☁️ Cloud QA & Mobile Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    I embraced platforms like <strong>BrowserStack</strong> and <strong>SauceLabs</strong> to scale
                    testing
                    across devices and browsers. I led mobile automation efforts, simulating real-world conditions and
                    ensuring
                    seamless user experiences.

                <h3>🤝 Mentorship & Leadership</h3>
                <p>
                    As a <strong>QA Lead</strong>, I’ve mentored freshers, guided teams, and built resources that
                    empower others.
                    Helping others grow has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey—turning potential into
                    confidence.

                <h3>🔮 Future Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m passionate about <strong>AI-driven testing</strong>, <strong>cloud platforms</strong>, and
                    <strong>mobile testing at scale</strong>. The future of QA lies in blending human insight with
                    intelligent
                    automation—and I’m committed to shaping that future.
