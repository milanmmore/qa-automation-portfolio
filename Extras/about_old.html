            <h2>📍 Where It Started</h2>
            <p>
                My academic journey began with a strong foundation in science. I chose it as my career path and
                completed my
                graduation with determination and curiosity. My parents—especially my mother—always encouraged me to
                pursue
                education and become a successful woman. Her belief in me inspired me to aim higher, and I enrolled in a
                Master’s program in Inorganic Chemistry.

            <p>
                After completing my post-graduation, I moved to Pune following my marriage. I was eager to start
                working, but
                most chemical companies were located far outside the city, making it difficult to find a suitable
                opportunity
                nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
                With my husband’s support, I decided to pivot. I enrolled in a computer course and later pursued an MBA,
                opening
                the door to a new world of possibilities. It was the Y2K era—a time of transformation in the tech
                industry—and I
                landed my first job in an IT company as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back then, developers were responsible for testing their own code. When the QA role emerged, I saw an
                opportunity to shift into testing. The demanding schedule of development pushed me toward QA, and I
                found myself
                truly enjoying every phase of the journey —from learning the basics to leading teams and mentoring
                others.
                Testing gave me not just a career, but a purpose.

            <h2>🚀 Growth & Mastery</h2>
            <p>
                My passion for software testing grew stronger with every challenge I faced. I eventually enrolled in an
                automation course to learn Selenium, and with the help of Google and real-time projects, I began
                applying it
                practically. I also taught myself Java—despite not coming from a computer science background—which was
                no small
                feat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I’m exploring Generative AI and its potential to transform QA workflows. But the journey hasn’t
                always
                been smooth. The toughest part was interviews—especially when I lacked hands-on experience. I realized
                that
                without practical knowledge, it’s hard to express your capabilities confidently.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why I created this platform: to bring together all the tools, resources, and insights I wish I
                had when I
                started. If I struggled with it, chances are someone else is too—and I want to make their path easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s still so much more to learn. The world is evolving, technologies are changing—but I believe
                where
                there’s a will, there’s a way. We all start somewhere. And if you’re on a similar ground, know that
                you’re not
                alone.
            </p>

                    “You don’t need a tech degree to thrive in QA—you need curiosity, courage, and consistency.”

            <h2>💡 What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
        After completing a long-term project, I was ready to transition to a new challenge within my organization. The
        interview—conducted by an internal employee—was for a role involving a new tool and a different programming
        language. Though I had given a client interview four years earlier, this felt like stepping into unfamiliar
        territory.
    </p>
    <p>
        I embraced the opportunity to learn, dedicating myself to mastering the new tool. My first interview came just
        one month into this journey, followed by another two months later. Despite my experience and readiness for the
        role, the interviews focused heavily on coding syntax—an area that often overshadows practical capability.
    </p>
    <p>
        That experience was eye-opening. It reminded me that even seasoned professionals can face hurdles—not due to
        lack of skill, but because interview formats don’t always reflect real-world QA responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided to turn this challenge into a mission: to share my journey, consolidate my learnings, and create
        resources that help others navigate similar paths. This platform is my way of giving back—empowering testers
        with practical knowledge, confidence, and community.
    </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <strong>
                        “Interviews test syntax. Experience proves capability.”
                 </strong>
                </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                                <strong>
                                    “Every challenge is a chance to grow—and to help others grow with you.”    
                                </strong>
                                </blockquote>





    <p>
                In reality, every tester leans on existing automation frameworks, community support, and now, Generative
                AI.
                I’ve rarely seen a tester write flawless code from memory—but I’ve seen many solve real-world problems
                with
                collaboration and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why I believe it’s time to shift from traditional interview techniques to a modern, practical
                approach. I
                started learning automation tools with the help of Gen AI, and now I’m committed to helping others do
                the
                same—especially those who feel overwhelmed by the gap between theory and practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in sharing knowledge and helping others grow. That’s why I created this site—to guide testers
                through
                the challenges I once faced. Whether you're just starting or looking to level up, I’m here to help you
                learn
                faster and grow confidently.
